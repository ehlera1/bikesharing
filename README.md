# Bikeshare Analysis  
## Overview
#### My friend Kate and I recently took a trip of a lifetime to New York City. After the trip was completed, we realized the part of the magic of the trip was access to a bike sharing program called “CitiBikes”. Kate had the brilliant idea to bring a similar business to her hometown of Des Moines Iowa. I agreed and will use some of the recent skills I’ve learned in Tableau to help make a pitch to an angel investor.

## Summary: 
### While our code ran at a reasonable time there are clearly advantages to having refactored it. The first advantage is that it runs much more efficiently and in a fraction of the time of our original macro. Also having refactored it and including the formatting into one routine we have eliminated a few extra clicks for Steve. 
### The downside to refactoring the original VBA script is that there are a few more lines of code to read though and if any future adjustments are needed it may be more complicated to implement them.

# Bikeshare Analysis  
## Overview
#### My friend Kate and I recently took a trip of a lifetime to New York City. After the trip was completed, we realized the part of the magic of the trip was access to a bike sharing program called “CitiBikes”. Kate had the brilliant idea to bring a similar business to her hometown of Des Moines Iowa. I agreed and will use some of the recent skills I’ve learned in Tableau to help highlight data on this program in NYC  that Kate can then use to make a pitch to an angel investor.

## Results: 
#### Below will highlight the results of our analysis. Also, by following the link that follows you can navigate to the interactive dashboard: [Link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.ehlers/viz/NYCBikeshareChallenge/NYCBikeshareStory?publish=yes)

### Trip Duration Line Visualizations 
#### There are two visualizations below that highlight how long users are essentialy utilizing the CitiBikes. The first, is simplistic and simply shows the number of bikes in relations to the mitues of the trip duration. The second is very similiar information with a line for each gender.

### Weekday Heat Maps 
#### The next visualizations that we created are in a heat map format. The first shows the times and days of the week that were most popular, the scale for this visulization is located in the top right corner. Our second heat map is distilled one level further with a map for each gender and is in the same format as our initall heat map. The third breaks this down even futher by user type, in this visualization shows that subscribers make up the bulk of the usage.

### Start/End Geographic Maps
#### As our intial results highlihgted that trips are reletively short, more frequent during normal commuting times and business days we wanted to see if there were any insights we could show for the start and end locations. The two below show that the bulk of the starting and ending locations were in the mid-town area. We hypothises that this could be from the higher population density in this area and that traveling by bike in a congested area is simply the quickest and most effecinet form of transportation in this area, more analsyis would be needed to confirm.

## Summary: 
### To summarize our findings, we have gathered inforation on the trip durations, peak time and days of the week as well as where there seems to be the most activitiy based on geography. In New York City, the majority of riders are male, travleing at normal commutning times (to or from work) Monday - Friday (business days) in the mid-town area. 

### Further analysis that we recomend with this dataset is as follows: 
  1. We thing that by further distilling the demographics or showing the age of rides we would be able to further narrow down exactly what group of people are utilzing this resource. This would allow us to see if there are parallel demographics in the Des Moines area. It would be reletively simple to build a chart with average ages for each gender in Tableau. 
  2. I think that when starting a similar business in Des Moines we would further have to understand the reparis needed for the bikes and what specific bikes are getting used the most often. Again building a chart with the data we have would the most effective way to communincate this information.
